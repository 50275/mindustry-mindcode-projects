# mindustry-mindcode-projects
Source code (in [Mindcode]([url](https://github.com/cardillan/mindcode))) for all of the Mindustry logic programs I've ever written. These aren't organized. Open an issue if you're curious or wish to report something inappropriate. It's also for Mindustry. 

While this repository is only intended for my programs, feel free to submit your own. (In this case I'd make a new folder to separate my own works from others' works.) 

Also note that none of my logics were made with multiplayer in mind. 

I'm aware that there are at least 2 files with JS code in them. I'll probably fix that after I learn to use git, whenever that is.
